 RCU --> CPU id = 3 ; he always work but i dont know how to work 
 i think RCU its work read and write but im not sure about that 
 so i search this point , and found many new information ;
 ok lets talk about pointers , if asken you what is pointers and 
 how to work pointers usauly we define it but only know in program c 
 but i talkin exactly how to work if i compile it and running program
 what happened pointers in kernel(operation system) , so let talk
 function of an operation system , we have process management ,
 and we know what is it, and how to work on general , but if you open 
 CMD (top) and search for example low id (id = 3 or id = 4 ..) 
 and you find name program work is (rcu_gp), that mean program primaly
 it work in system kernel so what is rcu , rcu is  READ-COPY-UPDATE and 
 how to work , we consider readers data structre can removal and reclaimed and ....,
 so lets talk some funtion have RCU, is rcu_assign_pointer() this function ,
 It performs the process of creating a pointer and given value with the address 
 on memory, so we understand, this operation RCU we find in CPU can bears(yata7amalo)
 all the process around pointers(data structure).
